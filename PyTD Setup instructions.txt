3.1. Set your Treasure Data API key as an environment variable
Before launching Jupyter notebook, set your API key as an environment variable on your terminal. Your TD API key can be found in the TD console profile page.


export TD_API_KEY="1234/abcde..." # Replace to your appropriate key


3.2. Configuring Jupyter notebook


Before installing Python packages, create virtualenv in a terminal.


 pip install --upgrade virtualenv # if needed
 cd your-project # Rename with a directory name you created
 virtualenv --python python3 venv


After creating the virtual environment, activate the virtualenv. For macOS and Linux:


 source venv/bin/activate


After activating virtualenv, you can install pandas-td via pip as follows:


 pip install pandas-td


You also need to install Jupyter and related packages:


 pip install jupyter notebook matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
